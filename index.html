      <span>kilowatt hours of energy have been irreversibly degraded into entropy by stars
      <br>
      reachable by traveling at ninety-nine percent of the speed of light.</span>

      <span>Nanotechnological computers could have used this energy to emulate</span>

      <span>centuries of life for every person on earth.</span>

      <br>
      <span>chance of success, would be a net gain in time.</span>

      <span>But this delay has resulted in the loss of only</span>

      <br>
      <span>of the available resources in the universe.</span>
